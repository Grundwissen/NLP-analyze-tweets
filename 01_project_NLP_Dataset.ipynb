    "## Generating Datasets with a Twitter API\n",
    "This Project is divided in three main Jupyter Notebooks. The first Notebook (\"01_project_NLP_Dataset\") constains the overview of the Twitter API's and how to generate a Dataset with those tools. The second and the third Notebook (\"02_project_NLP_nltk\") and (\"03_project_NLP_spacy\") represent the main part of the NLP project. In these two notebooks, NLP techniques such as tokenization, lemmatization, stop word removal and polarity classification are applied to various generated Twitter records. In addition, the results of NLP techniques are graphically displayed."

    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Tweepy is a Python library for accessing a Twitter API. Tweepy is used in this project for accessing the Streaming API and the Search API. Those API's enable downloading Tweets and metadata from Twitter users. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Streaming API\n",
    "The Streaming API is generating real-time data from Twitter. You can choose from different parameters to limit your generated data. For example the location of Tweets. In this project the Streaming API was used to generate real-time Tweets from the German cities Munich, Frankfurt, Berlin and Cologne. Furthermore the data was collected over four hours. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first step after accessing the data set is to look at the data. The Tweets looked bad. There are lot of different languages, lot of colloquial language and lot of useless not related information. After a hours of trying to clean the data, it turned out that you can get no usefull information out of this data set. Therefore there will be no further analysis in this approach. Nevertheless the generated dataset is aviable. Maybe NLP tasks can be done on a larger dataset, but then a much bigger dataset has to be generated over days.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Search API\n",
    "Twitter provides with the Search API the possibility to collect up to 3200 Tweets from one user. Against the background to generate a useful NLP data set, three famous Twitter personalities were selected. Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have an active Twitter account and are, because of the Presidential election in the United States in 2016, related to each other. These properties are very useful for analyzing and comparing Tweets against the background of NLP.\n"

    "##### Important to know\n",
    "While using the Twitter API's, there is a individual key required. This key will be send by E-Mail from Twitter and is for personal usage only. This key is hidden in the following code example. If someone want to run this code, to generate the data set, then a separate key must be used. But there is no use to run this code, because all of the generated data is provided in the Project folder."
